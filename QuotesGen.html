'“When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.”',
'Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do.',
'When I dare to be powerful – to use my strength in the service of my vision, then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid',
'Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.',
'A successful man is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks others have thrown at him.',
'Those who dare to fail miserably can achieve greatly.',
'I can’t give you a sure-fire formula for success, but I can give you a formula for failure: try to please everybody all the time.',
'Would you like me to give you a formula for success? It’s quite simple, really: Double your rate of failure. You are thinking of failure as the enemy of success. But it isn’t at all. You can be discouraged by failure or you can learn from it, so go ahead and make mistakes. Make all you can. Because remember that’s where you will find success.',
'It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed.',
'I’m a success today because I had a friend who believed in me and I didn’t have the heart to let him down.',
'Love yourself first and everything else falls into line. You really have to love yourself to get anything done in this world.',
'Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love.',
'Challenges are what make life interesting and overcoming them is what makes life meaningful.',
'Love is a serious mental disease.',
'Our greatest fear should not be of failure… but of succeeding at things in life that don’t really matter.',
'It had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them. They went out and happened to things.',
'Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more',
'It is our choices, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.',
'Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone.',
'If you want to be happy, be.',
'Many of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up',
'If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things.',
'The opposite of love is not hate; it’s indifference.',
